### Handling Varying Excel File Structures

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unknown Column Counts    | The API dynamically processes each row based on the number of columns it contains. It doesnâ€™t assume a fixed column count, allowing it to adapt to Excel files where some rows have more or fewer columns. |
| Mixed Data Types         | All data is extracted as a string for consistency. For example, whether a cell contains a number, date, or text, it will be processed as a string. You can further process this data on the client side if necessary. |
| Multiple Sheets          | The API processes data from all sheets in the Excel file. Data from each sheet is extracted and returned in the response, preserving the structure of each sheet. |
